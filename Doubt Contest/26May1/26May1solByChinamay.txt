The code is almost perfect.
Only u need to print the last ‘cout’ line like this;

cout<<”The number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers as :”<<c<<”=”<<a<<”+”<<b<<endl;

Just replace last cout like this and the code runs perfectly.

We do like this coz ‘=’ ,’+’ ,’-‘ ,’*’ sign cannot be interpreted by complier as they interpret the variable or arguments.
So we put them in double quotes for them to be displayed on the screen.
